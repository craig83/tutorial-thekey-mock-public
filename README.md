# The Key

> Every government has its secret service branch. America, CIA; France, Deuxi√®me Bureau;   England, MI5. NATO also has its own. A messy job? Well that's when they usually call on me or someone like me. Oh yes, my name is Drake, John Drake.

Good morning, Mr Drake.

We've called you in because we have discovered a plot involving double agents both in our agency and also in the USA.  

We have discovered two electronic dead drops -- one here and one in America -- disguised as ordinary (and quite ugly) garden ornaments in parks where agents regularly take their lunch.

The dead drops are a Ruritanian design, so we expect the Ruritanian Secret Service is behind this. It's based on hacked technology that works with our very own spy phones.

Whenever an agent passes the drop, the agent's spy phone transmits a secret code. If the code matches the dead drop's own code, then the dead drop exchanges data with the agent's spy phone. Remember: any spy phone will emit a code, but only the moles' spy phones will emit the *right* code.

We believe both dead drops are using the same code. 

We need you to discover the code, and to identify the moles on both sides of the Atlantic. You will have the services of the master forger, Mr Mockito. 

In Britain you're going to have to be extra careful. The dead drops produce a cryptographic verifier, and British phones are known to check this verifier. If a British phone gets an incorrect verifier, it'll spook the agent. We don't want our suspects fleeing before we can arrest them! 

Please hurry -- these dead drops are storing a regularly updated feed of information from those agents' phones, and we don't know when the RSS will come to collect them.

If you choose to accept this mission, please clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/UQdeco2800/tutorial-thekey-mock-publish.git) and get to work.
The plan is in the tests.

regards,
W.
